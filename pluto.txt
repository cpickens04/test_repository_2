They say you're not a planet, my dear, but you will always be to me. I 
love you.

BTW, there are a load of new "planets" that they claim are larger than 
you. Ultimately, it's important that you know there are many wonderful 
advances in space exploration. So while your status has changed for now, 
we're still moving in the right direction.
